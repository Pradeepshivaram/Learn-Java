**Variables in Java**

Get an introduction to variables, their naming conventions, where they are stored in memory, and how much space they take.

**Introduction** 
    Variables are just like containers which hold the values while the program is executed.

A variable is a storage location paired with an associated symbolic name (an identifier), which contains some known or unknown quantity of information referred to as a value.

Variables in Java are strongly typed; thus they all must have a data type declared with their identifier. In this lesson, we will discuss identifiers.


**Naming a variable**
Just as every person has a name that helps identify them, every variable has a name associated with it. There are certain naming conventions that one must follow in order to decide a name for the variable. This name is called the variable’s identifier. Variable names should be descriptive based on what data item they are declared to store.

There are three rules to create an identifier:

1. Characters from A to Z, as well as their lowercase counterparts, can be used.
2. Numbers from 0-9 can be used.
3. Special characters that can be used are $ (the dollar sign) and _ (underscore).

*Note:*

A variable must never start with a number
The identifier can not have spaces in it


**Where are the variables stored?**

Variables, once declared in the program, are allocated space in memory. Memory itself is organized as a long collection of one byte after another. These bytes are sequentially numbered, with the number being referred to as a memory address for the corresponding location. It is customary to use hexadecimal numbers to show the addresses of memory locations.

The value of a given variable is stored in some memory location. Referring to a piece of data using its address is tedious, that is why programming languages provide the abstraction of referring to each piece of data with a variable name.

**Size of a variable?**

The number of locations occupied by a given variable gives the size of the variable in memory. For example, a shorter piece of text like “Hello!” occupies less memory than a longer one, like “Hello world!”. Java programs have different data types that define the space that a variable takes. The smallest space that a variable can take is a data type called byte that takes one byte.
